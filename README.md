# PyCairo&PIL creative Python

This repository contains two Python projects. Python packages PyCairo and PIL are used.
I started these projects as a hands-on introduction to generative arts and image processing.

These projects has also helped me getting more fluent in Python. One may find unsophisticated code with poor commenting. Nevertheless they mark my journey to become a better programmer.
