# PyCairo&PIL creative Python

This repository contains 2 creative coding projects written in Python. Mudules such as PyCairo and PIL were used. I started these projects as an introduction to generative arts and image processing.

These projects also served the purpose of getting more fluent in Python. As a result one may find unsophisticated code implementation with poor comments and documentation.
